This is a personal configuration of uBlue, currently using Hyprland, I would not recommend using this directly unless you are me, or are okay with your system changing underneath you. If you wish to use this I recommend forking the repo and modifying what I have built for your use case. I put this together to have a solid base for my computers, that is easy to update in one place and have it automatically propagate.
